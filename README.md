# Jarvis
A chat app that includes a friendly assistant named Jarvis to answer any questions. No need to leave the chat to search the web. Jarvis will do his best to answer your questions.

## To-Do
- Fix repeating background gradient
- Fix regex to answer questions ending in '?' and start with '@Jarvis'. Right now regex does not catch a question that doesn't have a '?' at the end.
- Fix speechbubble so that if user enters consecutive chats it is on the right side.
- Add functionality to save User's and their Messages to the DB.
- Refactor 'socket' and remove global 'socket' variable.
- To deploy:
 - Fix the issues above.
